<div style="text-align: justify">
Field robotics tackles the problem of developing, deploying, and evaluating autonomous mobile systems in unstructured and often dynamic environments. Typical commercial applications are in agriculture, construction, mining, and forestry. The range of physical mediums is also very diversified: in the air, on the ground, underground, on the water, and underwater. These can be located on Earth, or on other celestial bodies (e.g., planets, moons, or asteroids). As such, field robotics works under wildly diverse and radically different assumptions than other areas of robotics, which tend to have well-defined working hypotheses. Therefore, this creates its own set of challenges. This workshop will thus offer the opportunity to present work and discuss how these unique challenges can be solved.

This workshop will bring together experts, researchers, and practitioners to discuss the latest advancements in field robotics. Participants will gain valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that arise in deploying robots in diverse field scenarios, such as rugged terrains, remote locations, and hazardous environments. Practical case studies and real-world applications will be presented to showcase the successful, and not-so-successful cases of field robotics. The workshop will encourage fruitful dialogues and collaborative discussions, culminating by a panel at the end of the workshop. Attendees will leave with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art technologies, the main actors, and upcoming challenges.

## Submission guidelines

FR workshop accepts contributions based on the following criteria:

- The submission should be about 2 pages long (excluding references). The paper should follow the [IEEE RAS template](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php).
- The review process is single-blind, and at least two reviewers will review the submitted papers based on the novelty, relevance of the workshop topics, and clarity of language. We welcome perspective and conceptual papers as well.
- TODO: The papers should be submitted to this adress: ...
- Accepted papers will be available on the workshop website. The authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their results in a poster session during the workshop.
